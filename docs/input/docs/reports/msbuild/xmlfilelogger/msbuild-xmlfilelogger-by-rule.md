Title: Grouped By Rule Number
---

This report can be generated from a MsBuild log file generated by the [XmlFileLogger] from the MSBuild Extension Pack
and shows all warnings and errors reported in the log file grouped by rule number.

## Sample code

To create the report use the [CodeAnalysisReport.MsBuildXmlFileLoggerByRule] value:

```csharp
#addin "Cake.CodeAnalysisReporting"

Task("create-report").Does(() =>
{
    CreateMsBuildCodeAnalysisReport(
        @"C:\build\msbuild.log",
        CodeAnalysisReport.MsBuildXmlFileLoggerByRule,
        @"C:\build\issuesByAssembly.html");
}
```
